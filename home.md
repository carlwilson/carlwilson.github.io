## This is a Vanilla GitHub Pages Site

This is the best way of familiarising yourself with GitHub pages while perfecting your GitHub markdown fu.

## Page Source

The raw markdown for this published page can be found here: <https://github.com/carlwilson/carlwilson.github.io/blob/master/home.md>

### YAML Front Matter

To set this home page up, there's a little bit of metadata required in the page header:

```yaml
---
layout: home
title: "Carl's GitHub Pages Home Page"
permalink: /
---
```

The `layout` key selects the layout of your page. The standard set is:

- default
- home
- page
- post

The `title` key is self-explanatory. The `permalink` key gives the page's URL within the site, in this case, the root, `/`.

## Ideas for Improving this Page

You can even use Markdown to create simple task lists.

- [ ] Add some Markdown references to the page
- [x] The site could look nicer
- [ ] An about me section wouldn't hurt
